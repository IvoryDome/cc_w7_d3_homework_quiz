1. What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
Allows variables, objects and functions to take on different forms and to perform different tasks.


2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
	
Using interfaces to allow several classes to perform the same function and using inheritance to allow classes to use functions/variables/objects from other classes.


	public interface IOutput
	public abstract class VideoDevice
	public class Monitor extends VideoDevice implements IOutput 


3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
We can use interfaces and inheritance from multiple classes


4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
Theoretically an infinite amount of forms.


5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
When you have a number of similar classes that share the same functions.


6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
Composition is the concept that classes should be arranged in such a way as to re-use as much code as possible and that a class (and object) can be composed of many different objects.


7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
When you want a number of classes that are inherited from a parent class to have different functionality than the rest, without modifying the whole class structure or adding it unnecessarily to the classes that don't require it

eg.  
	


8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?
It allows you to compact your code, to reuse as much as possible and to future-proof the code by making it very simple to add new classes/functions/variables etc.



9. What happens to the behaviours when the object composed of them is destroyed?
